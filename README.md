PhoneNow Call Centre Agents Performance Visualization
Project Overview
In this project, I developed a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize the performance of call centre agents at PhoneNow. The goal was to provide actionable insights into key performance metrics, identify areas for improvement, and enhance overall operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Key Visualizations
The dashboard includes several insightful visualizations:

Total Incoming Calls: A summary card showing the total number of incoming calls (4054) handled by the call centre.
Number of Agents: A summary card displaying the total number of agents (8) in the call centre.
Satisfaction Rating by Agent: A bar chart visualizing the satisfaction ratings for each agent, with Jim having the highest and Joe the lowest.
Total Calls Answered by Each Agent: A column chart comparing the number of calls answered by each agent, providing a clear view of individual agent workloads.
Agent Speed of Answering Calls: A line chart tracking the speed at which each agent answers calls, indicating efficiency levels.
Resolved/Unresolved Issues: A pie chart showing the percentage of resolved versus unresolved issues, with 89.34% of issues resolved.
Insights and Impact
Performance Metrics: The dashboard effectively highlights key performance indicators such as total calls handled, agent efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
Agent Comparison: By comparing individual agent performance, the dashboard helps identify top performers and those needing additional support or training.
Operational Efficiency: The visualization of the speed of answering calls and the distribution of call volumes across agents helps in optimizing resource allocation and identifying bottlenecks.
Customer Satisfaction: The correlation between agent performance and satisfaction ratings provides valuable insights into how agent actions impact customer experiences.
Issue Resolution: Tracking resolved and unresolved issues helps in understanding the effectiveness of the call centre in addressing customer concerns.
Tools and Techniques Used
Data Aggregation: Integrated data from multiple sources to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
Power BI: Utilized Power BI for creating interactive and user-friendly visualizations.
DAX and Power Query: Employed DAX for complex calculations and Power Query for efficient data transformation.
User Feedback Integration: Incorporated feedback from end-users to refine and improve the dashboardâ€™s usability and relevance.
Conclusion and Reflections
This project significantly improved the visibility of call centre operations at PhoneNow. The insights derived from the dashboard informed strategic decisions, leading to enhanced agent performance and higher customer satisfaction. This experience not only deepened my expertise in data visualization but also reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving operational efficiency.
